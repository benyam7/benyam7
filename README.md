## üëã About Me

Dreaming up ideas and bringing them to life, especially in the world of SaaS, is where my passion truly lies.

Outside of programming, I have a diverse set of hobbies that include:
- Traveling
- Kickboxing, sparring with the boys
- Walking and running in the mornings and evenings
- Attending fight events like UFC <3

If you're ever in Addis Ababa, where I currently reside, we could:
